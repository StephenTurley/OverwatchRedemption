# Overwatch Redmption


Feel free to download the latest build of Overwatch from [Here](http://www.overwatchredemption.com).

This is a two player cooporative game, so bring a friend. If you don't have any friends, email me and I'll see what I can do. 

The "linux" version should run on Linux, Windows, and Mac. (It's just a .jar that will download the correct files for your platform)

There is also a Windows executable version there, if you like pretty icons. 
___
The file will download game data to one of three locations depending on your platform.

1.  **Linux** - ~/<UserName>/.overwatch/
2.  **Windows** - /Users/<UserName>/AppData/Roaming/.overwatch/
3. **Mac** - ~/<UserName/.overwatch/

If you wish to remove the game, simply remove the directory for your platform.

```This game is in very early development and I can't garantee that it will behave at all times.  While I don't think the game will do much    more than crash during a catastrophic failure, I cannot guarantee that it won't harm your computer system.Please only run this software if you understand and accept the risks.```
