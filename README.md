# Overwatch Redemption

Feel free to download the latest build of Overwatch from [here](http://www.overwatchredemption.com).

This is a two player cooporative game, so bring a friend. If you don't have any friends, email me and I'll see what I can do. 

The "linux" version should run on Linux, Windows, and Mac. (It's just a .jar that will download the correct files for your platform)

There is also a Windows executable version there, if you like pretty icons. 

The file will download game data to one of three locations depending on your platform:

1. **Linux** - ~/.overwatch
2. **Windows** - C:/Users/<UserName>/AppData/Roaming/.overwatch
3. **Mac** - ~/.overwatch

If you wish to remove the game, simply remove the directory for your platform.

```
This game is in very early development and I can't guarantee that it will behave at all times.
While I don't think the game will do much more than crash during a catastrophic failure
I cannot guarantee that it won't harm your computer system.
Please only run this software if you understand and accept the risks.
```
